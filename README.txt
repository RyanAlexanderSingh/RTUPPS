This is a joint project by Ryan Singh, Juan Miguel Huertas Delgado and Sam Hayhurst.
We are currently postgraduate students studying MSc Computer Games and Entertainment at Goldsmiths, University of London.

In this project, we are aiming to implement a portion of the SIGGRAPH paper by Macklin et al, 
titled: Real Time Unified Particle Physics System. 

We are doing this project to learn more about OpenGL parallel processing and physics systems.

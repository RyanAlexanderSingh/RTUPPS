This is a combine project by Ryan Singh, Juan Miguel Huertas Delgado and Sam Hayhurst.
We are master's stuednts at Goldsmiths reading Computer Games and Entertainment.

In this project we hope to implement a portion of the SIGGRAPH paper by Macklin et al, 
titled: Real Time Unified Particle Physics System. We are doing this to learn OpenGL 
parallel processing and physics systems.
